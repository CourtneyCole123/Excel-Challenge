# Excel-Challenge

Conclusions:
•	Crowdfunding campaigns appear to be successful.
•	Plays tend to be the primary sub-category in which crowdfunding is utilized.
•	Moderate goals (between 15000 and 40000) tend to gain the most backing.

Limitations:
•	Sample size (only certain countries were included. Why?)
•	Time (it appears this data is a snapshot in time)

Additional tables/graphs:
•	We could create a pivot table to see if staff picks or spotlights were drivers of successful campaigns.
•	We could create a scatter plot to see if there is a correlation between the year and the amount pledged (Were there certain years that were more/less successful? Were there outside financial factors contributing to the success/failure of campaigns?)
