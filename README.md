# Excel-Challenge

<pre> Conclusions: </pre>
•	Crowdfunding campaigns appear to be successful. <br />
•	Plays tend to be the primary sub-category in which crowdfunding is utilized. <br />
•	Moderate goals (between 15000 and 40000) tend to gain the most backing. <br />
<pre> Limitations:</pre>
•	Sample size (only certain countries were included. Why?)<br />
•	Time (it appears this data is a snapshot in time)<br />
<pre> Additional tables/graphs:</pre>
•	We could create a pivot table to see if staff picks or spotlights were drivers of successful campaigns.<br />
•	We could create a scatter plot to see if there is a correlation between the year and the amount pledged (Were there certain years that were more/less successful? Were there   outside financial factors contributing to the success/failure of campaigns?)
